        About Cookies & How We Use Them
      </h4>
      <p class="pt-space-xs">
        A cookie is a tiny text file that records actions that you make on a
        website. All transactional/e-commerce sites require these so that you
        are able to "Add" items to shopping carts that remain there throughout
        the duration of your visit. This allows you to add multiple different
        products in one visit and purchase once your browsing is complete,
        should you wish to do so. We do not collect personal data from these and
        they are only used in order to make your shopping experience more
        convenient and enjoyable.
      </p>
      <p class="pt-space-xs">
        In addition, we use other cookies that improve our website so that it is
        more user friendly, contains richer content for you, and offers a more
        relevant experience to you as an individual and valued customer. For
        example, cookies that "remember" you from previous visits to our sites
        so that we can offer you relevant products and automatically sign you in
        to your account on reaching the site and cookies that allow "streaming"
        from other sites which enable us to play videos and display feeds direct
        from our accounts on various well-known social media platforms.

        Furthermore, we use cookies to monitor certain performance statistics,
        i.e. what search term brought you to our website; whether you are on a
        PC or mobile device; how long you stayed on our site; etc. We use these
        solely for the purpose of improving our service and understanding our
        customersâ€™ intentions on a larger scale, so that we can improve our site
        to deliver the best possible service.
